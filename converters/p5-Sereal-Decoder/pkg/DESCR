This library implements a deserializer for an efficient, compact-output,
and feature-rich binary protocol called Sereal.

Its sister module p5-Sereal-Encoder implements an encoder for this format.
ALWAYS upgrade THIS package BEFORE upgrading the p5-Sereal-Encoder package.
The latest version of the decoder (this package) should be able to handle
the output from any earlier or equivalent version of the encoder. Ignoring
this advice may result in data loss in an environment where you cannot
upgrade the encoder simultaneously on all machines using the package.
