This library implements an efficient, compact-output, and feature-rich
serializer using a binary protocol called Sereal.

Its sister module p5-Sereal-Decoder implements a decoder for this format.
ALWAYS upgrade p5-Sereal-Decoder BEFORE upgrading this package. The latest
version of the decoder can read the output from all previous or equivalent
versions of the encoder. However a newer encoder may produce output that an
older decoder cannot handle. Updagrading this package without upgrading
p5-Sereal-Decoder first may result in data loss.
